/**
 * RDF model classes which implement the proposed W3C Pointer classes.
 * From the W3C documentation, pointers are entities that permit identifying
 * a portion or segment of a piece of content - making use of the
 * Resource Description Framework (RDF). It also describes a number of specific
 *  types of pointers that permit portions of a document to be referred to in
 *  different ways. When referring to a specific part of, say, a piece of web content,
 *  it is useful to be able to have a consistent manner by which to refer to a particular
 *  segment of a web document, to have a variety of ways by which to refer to that
 *  same segment, and to make the reference robust in the face of changes to that document.
 *
 *  Pointers are used to describe SPDX Snippet ranges.
